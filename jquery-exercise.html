    //---- jQuery Exercises: ----//

    // - How do we target the HTML element with class "el"?

    // - How do we make "el" disappear?
    //     - What exactly happened in the DOM to make el disappear?

    // - How do we make el re-appear?

    // - How do we make el disappear slowly? Can we do it even slower?

    // - How do we make el re-appear slowly? Can we do it faster?

    // - How do we make el collapse?

    // - How do we make el re-expand?

    // - How do we make el collapse if it's there, but expand if it's not, without writing a complicated "if" statement?
    //     - What's a common page element that might use this idea?

    // - How do we make el's background color change? (There are several ways to do this. Could you do it without inline styles?)

    // - How can we go back and forth between classes?
    //     - Can we use this new back-and-forth idea with other actions?

    // - How do we change the text inside el?
    //     - Whoops! Did we remove the link and button too? If so, why?
    //     - What if we wanted to make our new text italic?

    // - How do we add a photo into el? (http://lorempixel.com/300/200/)

    // - How to we get rid of everything inside el, but keep it? Can you think of 2 ways?

    // - How do we actually take el out of the page entirely (instead of just hiding it)?

    // - Can we change both the page AND el's background colors in a SINGLE command? If so, how?

    // - What if we wanted to make el collapse, and THEN change the page's background color?
    //     - This idea is what developers call a "callback." You'll hear it a lot; it's basically just
    //       a function that gets triggered as soon as another function finishes.

    // - How do we add another "el" element onto the page AFTER el?

    // - How do we add another "el" element onto the page BEFORE el?
    //     - Whoops! We actually added 2 new elements. Why?

    // - How do we get rid of ONLY the first "el" element?

    // - How do we only add an element AFTER the last element?

    // - How do we only add an element after the SECOND element?

    // - How do we detect if the button is clicked on?
    //     - How do we make something happen when the button is clicked?

    // - How do we disable the button?
    //     - Does our click-detecting function work anymore?

    // - How do we re-enable the button?
    //     - How could we remove inline styles using this same idea?

    // - How do we prevent the link click from opening the linked page?

    // - How do we detect if the button is hovered over? (This one has some gotchas.)

    // - Man, that's annoying. How do we REMOVE that hover-detecting function we just created?
    //     - Why is this function called what it is?

    // - How could we only do something the FIRST time the button is hovered over, but never again?

    // - How do we make our click-function happen without actually clicking on it?

    // - How do we prevent our button click from also being detected as a click on el, its parent container? (This is an advanced one, but really nice to know.)

    // - How can we POSSIBLY REMEMBER all these?
    //     - We don't have to. They're all listed and explained at http://api.jquery.com/
    //     - Bonus: All of these things can be accomplished with plain JavaScript,
    //       sometimes just as easily. Check out http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/ to see how.

    // - Further learning:
    //     - How do we pull in content from another page or website? (Hint: use AJAX)
    //     - How can we change or pull data out of forms? (http://api.jquery.com/category/forms/)
